# 🌞 Linear Regression: Predicting Plant Output Energy from Ambient Temperature 🌡️

Welcome to our interactive Jupyter Notebook project, where we delve into the fascinating world of Linear Regression to predict Plant Output Energy (PE) based on Ambient Temperature (AT). This notebook is designed to provide a hands-on, visual approach to understanding the relationship between temperature and energy output.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://https://github.com/sonainjameel/ML_Linear_Regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd ML_Linear_Regression
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## 📊 Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize the dataset to understand the relationship between variables.
- **Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implement linear regression to predict Plant Output Energy.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance.

## 🛠 Installation
